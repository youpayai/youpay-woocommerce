== Description ==

This plugin enables the YouPay payment option in your WordPress Woocommerce store.

YouPay is a new payment option at the checkout, allowing your customers to securely share a payment link with their chosen payer. This empowers your customers to conveniently request items be paid by an external payer.

The external payer will be presented with your chosen payment options (e.g. PayPal and/or Stripe) meaning the funds for the payment are securely transferred to you using your regular payment methods.

YouPay is completely free for both the recipient customer and their chosen payer. YouPay does not charge you, the store owner, any additional fees. Store owners pay their regular payment gateway fees when a payment is made.

Upon payment, the order is flagged as paid, allowing you to ship the product to the recipient customer.

YouPay recommends you keep the recipient customer and payer details private from each other.
